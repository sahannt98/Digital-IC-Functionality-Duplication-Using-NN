# DIGITAL-IC-FUNCTIONALITY-DUPLICATION
#### Final Year Project - (Deep Learning)

In this innovative research, we introduce a groundbreaking method for duplicating digital circuits using the power of neural networks (NNs). Our approach revolves around training a versatile neural network model on the inputs and outputs of existing digital circuits, effectively creating a digital twin. With this digital twin in place, we can predict the outputs of any digital IC solely by using its inputs. We have validated this breakthrough using counter circuits and shift register circuits, achieving accurate functionality duplication. Additionally, we've successfully demonstrated how this technology can be applied to a robotic arm, empowering it with intelligent digital logic capabilities. Join us on this exciting journey as we explore the potential impact of our project and witness the seamless fusion of neural networks with digital circuitry.
